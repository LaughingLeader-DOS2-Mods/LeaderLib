				"\t• In extender v59, tooltip support for custom attributes now exist via GameHelpers.UI.RegisterCustomAttribute.",
				"\t• Added HitData:ForceMiss for Events.OnHit. This sets all the related properties to make a hit miss.",
				"\t• Added additional logic to LeaderLib's ComputeCharacterHit to make a hit fail if the hit has Missed/Blocked/Dodged. This fixes an issue where if a mod tried to make a hit not be successful, CCH sets Hit to true anyway (this is in the default logic of CCH), making the hit succeed.",

				"API Changes:",
				"\t• Added several new osiris event wrappers to Events.Osiris.",
				"\t• Reorganized ComputeCharacterHit events under Events.CCH. The previous events in will be preserved for compatibility.",
				"\t• Added Events.CCH.GetShouldApplyCriticalHit and Events.CCH.GetCriticalHitMultiplier.",
				"\t• Added a new SkillManager.Register.GetDamage listener, or providing the damage and damage param value for skills.",
				"\t• SkillManager listeners now better support fetching skill targets for skill types that don't fire Osiris events, such as MultiStrike. You can now see these targets in the Used and Cast skill states.",
				"\t• Added several new engine text entries to LocalizedText.",
				"\t• Added LocalizedText.AbilityDescriptions and LocalizedText.TalentDescriptions.",
				"\t• Added GameHelpers.Character.SetPermanentBoosts, for easier DynamicStats manipulation.",
				"\t• Added GameHelpers.Visual.GetVisualSet.",
				"\t• Added GameHelpers.Action.Resurrect.",
				"\t• Added GameHelpers.Character.GetEquipmentTalents.",

				"\t• Turn counters now support counting combat rounds.",

				"\t• Added StatusManager.Subscribe.GetEnterChance.",
				"\t• Added GameHelpers.Status.GetHealAmount and GameHelpers.Math.CalculateHealAmount.",
				"\t• Events.RegionChanged now includes the level data (e.Level).",
				"\t• Events.ClientCharacterChanged is now invoked when an origin preset changes in character creation.",
				"\t• The SkillManager now tracks how many listeners have subscribed to specific skills. This is so when unsubscribing, the 'enabled skills' are updated (i.e. if 1 mod listens for Fireball, but then it unsubscribes, the SkillManager will skip invoking events for Fireball)."
